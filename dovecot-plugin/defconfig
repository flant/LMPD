# Example plugin build time configuration
#
# This file lists the configuration options that are used when building the
# antispam plugin. All lines starting with # are ignored. Configuration option
# lines must be commented out completely, if they are not to be included,
# i.e. just setting VARIABLE=n is not disabling that variable.
#
# This file is included in Makefile, so variables like CFLAGS and LIBS can also
# be modified from here. In most cases, these lines should use += in order not
# to override previous values of the variables.

# Dovecot build/header directory
# Building the plugin requires configured dovecot sources or having
# configured it with --enable-header-install in which case you can
# point DOVECOT= to the installed headers too.
# If unset, it defaults to /usr/include/dovecot which typically is the
# right place so you don't have to worry about it.
#DOVECOT=../dovecot-1.0.5
#DOVECOT=../dovecot-1.1
#DOVECOT=/usr/include/dovecot

# install directory for 'make install'
# NB no need for a final '/'
INSTALLDIR=/usr/lib/dovecot/modules/imap

# plugin name, change only if you need to rename the plugin
# (for backward compatibility reasons, there no longer is a
# need for this since backends can be configured dynamically).
# If unset, defaults to "antispam" which is what you want.
# PLUGINNAME=antispam

# extra CFLAGS
# CFLAGS += -g3
