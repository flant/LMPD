# Example plugin build time configuration
#
# This file lists the configuration options that are used when building the
# antispam plugin. All lines starting with # are ignored. Configuration option
# lines must be commented out completely, if they are not to be included,
# i.e. just setting VARIABLE=n is not disabling that variable.
#
# This file is included in Makefile, so variables like CFLAGS and LIBS can also
# be modified from here. In most cases, these lines should use += in order not
# to override previous values of the variables.

# backend (select exactly one)
#  dspam-exec		- direct dspam training by calling dspam executable
#  signature-log	- signature logging using dovecot's dict API
#  mailtrain		- send mail to special addresses for training
#  crm114-exec		- direct crm114 training by calling mailreaver.crm

# Dovecot build/header directory
# Building the plugin requires configured dovecot sources or having
# configured it with --enable-header-install in which case you can
# point DOVECOT= to the installed headers too.
#DOVECOT=../dovecot-1.0.5
#DOVECOT=../dovecot-1.1
DOVECOT=/usr/include/dovecot

# install directory for 'make install'
# NB no need for a final '/'
INSTALLDIR=/usr/lib/dovecot/modules/imap
# The user and group for the installed plugin
USER=root
GROUP=root

# enable debugging to syslog or stderr
#DEBUG=stderr
#DEBUG=syslog

# verbose debugging (lots of output!)
#DEBUG_VERBOSE=1

# plugin name, change only if you need to rename the plugin
# (because, for example, you need two instances for different
# spam filters installed)
PLUGINNAME=antispam

# extra CFLAGS
# CFLAGS += -g3
